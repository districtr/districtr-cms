Welcome to Districtr CMS's documentation!
======================================================================

Introduction
------------
Districtr is the open-source web app that empowers all people to draw districting plans. This is the Wagtail CMS and API that manage the pages and data on the Districtr site.

Related Districtr Projects
--------------------------
This platform is part of a suite of programs that create Districtr.org.

* mapbox-gl-districtr: A Mapbox extension and tool library for drawing districting plans.
* districtr-client: The Districtr site built on Gatsby
* Other Districtr and MGGG data tools


Wagtail
-------
This project is built with Wagtail, a Django-based CMS. [Wagtail's documentation](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/) is for learning about developing with Wagtail. [The Wagtail Editor's Guide](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/editor_manual/index.html) is a good place to start if you are interested in learning how to use Wagtail to create and manage content.

Contributing
------------
This suite is under active development and will eventually replace the existing Districtr repository behind Districtr.org.

You can develop this project independently or along with other Districtr projects. If you are interested in contributing, thank you! You can visit the Github Project for the Districtr Reboot and see if there any of our open issues or milestones that you feel you could help with. You can also send an email to engineering@mggg.org to learn more about opportunities with Districtr and MGGG.
