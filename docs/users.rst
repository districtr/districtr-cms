Users
======================================================================

Custom user model for DistrictrCMS. 

.. note::
   This will eventually include details on permissions and roles. The API endpoint for users may eventually be a part of the authorization flow on the frontend client or another service may fill that role. At the very least there is an authorization token capability for other MGGG apps that may need to communicate with the CMS. 

.. note::
   The site serves several account pages for django-allauth but these are not currently used.
